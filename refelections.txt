Nov 10th: I had my firt interview for data analysis part-time position. I think I need to get better on Excel. I bought today a book on data analysis that will complement my studies. Probably will start now the Tableau lesson.
Nov 14th: I had my second interview. It looks like I was overqualified. So bye bye. 
Nov 16th: I learnt a lot on Excel and Tableau. Now working on the Tableau project.
